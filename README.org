 Note taking during talks is hard. Presenters move fast and often do not allow for sufficient time to note down a useful reference. fast-ref allows you to quickly add references into your notes file by prompting for, and auto-formatting, the important information.  

* Installation

  Download and add into your local path then add the below into you .emacs

  #+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/install")

;;set to t to insert into buffer at point
(setq fast-ref-auto-insert nil)


(require 'fast-ref)
  #+end_src


* Usage

Run fast-ref with ~M-x~. Enter text when prompted. Reference will be added to your buffer. Place into buffer with ~p~.

To auto insert citation at point set ~fast-ref-auto-insert~ to t (on by default). Switch to ~nil~ will hold the reference in the kill ring.  


* Todo

 * Allow for different formatting options.
 * Allow for different ref. styles to be chosen.
 * +Add option to auto-insert.+
