 Note taking during talks is hard. Presenters move fast and often do not allow for sufficient time to note down a useful reference. fast-ref allows you to quickly add references into your notes file by prompting for, and auto-formatting, the important information.  

* Installation

  Download and add into your local path then add the below into you .emacs

  #+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/install")

;;set to t to insert into buffer at point
(setq fast-ref-auto-insert nil)


(require 'fast-ref)
  #+end_src


* Usage

Run fast-ref with ~M-x~. Enter text when prompted, press ~RET~ to continue through the prompts. By default the reference will be added to your buffer at the point.

To auto insert citation at point set ~fast-ref-auto-insert~ to t (on by default). Switching to ~nil~ will hold the reference in the kill ring - place into buffer with ~p~.

The default is to format the reference in RSC style with org markdown elements. This can be changed by altering the ~fast-ref-cite-style~  variable. Currently ~asc~ and ~plain~ are available. User specified styles are planned. 

Please note - titles are not included as a deliberate design decision as that would slow down the taking down of references.
