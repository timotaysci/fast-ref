* fast-ref

  A package to quickly add formatted refrences into your buffer.

 Note taking during talks is hard. Presenters move fast and often do not allow for sufficient time to note down a useful reference. fast-ref allows you to quickly add references into your notes file by prompting for, and auto-formatting, the important information.

 This package currently defaults to format in the RSC style using org mode markdown elements - this can, of course, be customised. 

* Installation

  Download and add into your local path then add the below into you .emacs

  #+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/install")

;;set to t (or don't include this line) to insert into buffer at point 
(setq fast-ref-auto-insert nil)

;; set the style wanted - current options are "rsc", "acs" and "plain".
(setq fast-ref-cite-style "rsc")

(require 'fast-ref)
  #+end_src


* Usage

Run fast-ref with ~M-x~. Enter text when prompted, press ~RET~ to continue through the prompts. By default the reference will be added to your buffer at the point.

To auto insert citation at point set ~fast-ref-auto-insert~ to t (on by default). Switching to ~nil~ will hold the reference in the kill ring - place into buffer with ~p~.

The default is to format the reference in plain style with org markdown elements. This can be changed by altering the ~fast-ref-cite-style~  variable. Currently ~asc~ and ~plain~ are available. User specified styles are planned. 

To turn on per citation insert option, set ~fast-ref-per-ref-insert~ to t. This will prompt the user each time to determine if the reference should be inserted or kept in kill ring.

Please note - titles are not included as a deliberate design decision as that would slow down the taking down of references.

** User defined styles

   The user can define their own styles. First, set ~fast-ref-cite-style~ to ~"user"~ . The style can be defined by setting the variable ~fast-ref-user-define~ in the user's init.el.

   An example below:

   ~(setq fast-ref-user-define (concat fast-ref-first ", et al., " fast-ref-jour ", " fast-ref-yr ", " fast-ref-vol ", " fast-ref-pg "."))~
